# LogisticRegressionInPython
In this notebook, I analyze data from a Titanic dataset. First, I explore the data and drop variables that are not relevant to logistic regression. Then, I use matplotlib and seaborn to visualize the data. Finally, I create a logistic regression model to predict survivability on the Titanic.
